Heart Disease Prediction
Internship / Academic Project – Data Analytics & Machine Learning

This project analyzes patient health records to predict the likelihood of heart disease using data analytics and machine learning. It combines EDA, feature analysis, and predictive modeling to identify at-risk patients.

🧰 Tools Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC)

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

📊 Key Insights

Age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and maximum heart rate are important predictors of heart disease.

Male patients have a slightly higher risk than female patients in the dataset.

Correlation analysis identifies key features that strongly influence heart disease prediction.

Random Forest achieves high accuracy compared to other models.

Confusion matrix highlights correctly and incorrectly classified cases for model evaluation.

📁 Dataset

Kaggle - Heart Disease UCI

Features: Demographic (age, sex) & Clinical / Medical tests (cholesterol, blood pressure, max heart rate, etc.)

Target: target (0 = No heart disease, 1 = Heart disease)
